                    <h1>Travel to Darjeeling from Dhaka</h1>
                </header>

                <p>The first thing you need to do is passport and visa and make at least 5/6 photocopies of them. Also, keep 5/6 of your photos. I will give the link below on how to get a passport or visa. There are many AC and non AC transport buses plying from Dhaka Gabtali to Burimari land port in North Bengal. Among the non-AC buses, the fare of Hanif, Shyamoli, and Nabil costs you between Tk 750 to  950. The AC bus will cost nearly 1200 Tk, though they charge 1500+ when you go to Siliguri.</p>

                    <h1>Journey from Dhaka</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Most of the vehicles leave Dhaka for Burimari at 8 pm and will reach you at the Burimari border by 6-7 am. After reaching the border, have breakfast in Bangladesh, then cross the immigration of both countries (Bangladesh and India). When you reach Changrabandha, you can walk a short distance to board the bus. You have to keep in mind to reach Darjeeling between 7 and 8 PM. Because all the shops in Darjeeling are closed between 9 and 10 pm.</p>

                <p>This yearâ€™s destination is Mainaguri. It will take half an hour to go by bus. It will cost Rs.20 per person. From there you have to take the SBSTC bus to reach Siliguri. 80 rupees per person. If you need a mobile sim on reaching Siliguri, buy it here. After that start the journey again to Darjeeling. From Siliguri Junction, you have to take a jeep to Darjeeling. It will take 3/4 hours to reach there. This path will end to see a wonderful beauty. Reserve jeep will cost 2000 rupees and 8/10 people can go in reserve jeep or share jeep will charge 200/250 rupees per person.</p>

                <p>Along with the beauty of the day, you will also see the appearance of the evening which is very enjoyable. If you look down from the top of Darjeeling, you will think that it is a fair of millions of stars! These will look like lights from rooms in different buildings. There are many types of food in the hotels. There are several hotels for Muslims. You can eat at Islamia Hotel. For 100 rupees you will get beef and rice, along with pulses.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Between 1000 to 1500 rupees you will get a very good hotel with wifi and hot water. Hotel Parklane is a good hotel. Everything in Darjeeling shuts down before 10 pm. So booking and dinner must be completed by 10 PM.</p>

                    <h1>Where to go in Darjeeling?</h1>
                </header>

                <h2>1st day</h2>
                <p>Wake up at 3-4 am and head for Tiger Hill. You will see the smile of the sunrise touching the snow of the Himalayas. Then, spend the whole day exploring Batasia Loop, Rock Garden Ghum Station, Zoo (quite beautiful), Tea Garden, and Mall Road. There are several mosques in Darjeeling, the two big mosques are a must-see.</p>
                
                <h2>2nd day</h2>
                <p>Depart for Kanchan Jung, another town a little further away from Darjeeling city, where paragliding can be enjoyed. And one side of the Himalayas can be seen.</p>

                <h2>3rd day</h2>
                <p>If you want, you can visit the small town of Mirik surrounded by mountains and lakes. As Siliguri is nearer to Mirik, it is better to stay in Mirik. You can stay at the wooden restaurant in Miri for an affordable cost. The top view of the lake and the motel is great for touring Miri. So there is no question of staying more than one day.</p>

                <h2>4th day</h2>
                <p>Early morning leave for Siliguri. It takes only two hours to reach Siliguri from Mirik and three hours to reach the border from Siliguri. Remember, all border operations are closed after 6 pm.</p>
